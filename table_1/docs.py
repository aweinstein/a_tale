At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord
said he couldn't afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each
in a winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and
hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But
the fare was of the most substantial kind--not only meat and potatoes,
but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in
a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful
manner.''',

"Captain Ahab," said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far
been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed
struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. "Captain
Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick--but it was not Moby Dick that took off
thy leg?"
"Who told thee that?" cried Ahab; then pausing, "Aye, Starbuck; aye, my
hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that
brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye," he shouted with
a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;
"Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor
pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!" Then tossing both arms, with
measureless imprecations he shouted out: "Aye, aye! and I'll chase him
round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and
round perdition's flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have
shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and
over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.
What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look
brave."

"Aye, aye!" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
excited old man: "A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for
Moby Dick!"

"God bless ye," he seemed to half sob and half shout. "God bless ye,
men. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what's this long
face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not
game for Moby Dick?"

"I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain
Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I
came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance. How many barrels
will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it
will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market."

"Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest
a little lower layer. If money's to be the measurer, man, and the
accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by
girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let

("""Moby Dick is a symbolic work, but also includes chapters on natural history. Major themes include obsession, religion, idealism, courage versus pragmatism, revenge, racism, sanity, hierarchical relationships, and politics. All of the members of the crew have biblical-sounding, improbable, or descriptive names, and the narrator deliberately avoids specifying the exact time of the events (such as the giant whale disappearing into the dark abyss of the ocean) and some other similar details. These together suggest that the narrator  and not just Melville  is deliberately casting his tale in an epic and allegorical mode.

The white whale has also been seen as a symbol for many things, including nature and those elements of life that are out of human control.Ch 42 The character Gabriel, "in his gibbering insanity, pronounc[ed] the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible."[26] Melville mentions the Matsya Avatar of Vishnu, the first among ten incarnations when Vishnu appears as a giant fish on Earth and saves creation from the flood of destruction. Melville mentions this while discussing the spiritual and mystical aspects of the sailing profession and he calls Lord Vishnu as the first among whales and the God of whalers.

The Pequod's quest to hunt down Moby Dick itself is also widely viewed as allegorical. To Ahab, killing the whale becomes the ultimate goal in his life, and this observation can also be expanded allegorically so that the whale represents everyone's goals. Furthermore, his vengeance against the whale is analogous to man's struggle against fate. The only escape from Ahab's vision is seen through the Pequod's occasional encounters, called gams, with other ships. Readers could consider what exactly Ahab will do if he, in fact, succeeds in his quest: having accomplished his ultimate goal, what else is there left for him to do? Similarly, Melville may be implying that people in general need something to reach for in life, or that such a goal can destroy one if allowed to overtake all other concerns. Some such things are hinted at early on in the book, when the main character, Ishmael, is sharing a cold bed with his newfound friend, Queequeg:""",

Buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity. To be sure, it was an
unwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and to
give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own. But when the ends
of the rope were placed in the stranger's hands, he growled menacingly.
He had merely intimated his displeasure, in his pride believing that to
intimate was to command. But to his surprise the rope tightened around
his neck, shutting off his breath. In quick rage he sprang at the man,
who met him halfway, grappled him close by the throat, and with a deft
twist threw him over on his back. Then the rope tightened mercilessly,
while Buck struggled in a fury, his tongue lolling out of his mouth and
his great chest panting futilely. Never in all his life had he been so
vilely treated, and never in all his life had he been so angry. But his
strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he knew nothing when the train was
flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car.''',

The Jewish calendar is a [[lunisolar calendar]], or fixed lunar year, based on twelve [[lunar month]]s of twenty-nine or thirty days, with an [[intercalary]] lunar month added seven times every nineteen years (once every two to three years) to synchronize the twelve lunar cycles with the slightly longer [[solar year]]. Each Jewish lunar month starts with the [[new moon]]. Although originally the new lunar crescent had to be observed and certified by witnesses, the timing of the new moon is now determined mathematically.

Concurrently there is a weekly cycle of seven days, mirroring the [[creation week|seven-day period]] of the [[Book of Genesis]] in which the world is created. The names for the days of the week, like those in the Creation story, are simply the [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|day number]] within the week, with [[Shabbat]] being the seventh day. The Jewish day always runs from sunset to the next sunset; the formal adjustments used to specify a [[standard time]] and [[time zone]]s are not relevant to the Jewish calendar.

The twelve regular months are: [[Nisan]] (30 days), [[Iyar]] (29 days), [[Sivan]] (30 days), [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]] (29 days), [[Av (month)|Av]] (30 days), [[Elul]] (29 days), [[Tishrei]]  (30 days), [[Marcheshvan]] (29 or 30 days), [[Kislev]] (29 or 30 days), [[Tevet]] (29 days), [[Shevat]] (30 days), and [[Adar]] (29 days). In the leap years (such as 5771) an additional month, Adar I (30 days) is added after Shevat, and the regular Adar is referred to as "Adar II".

The first month of the festival year is Nisan. 15 Nisan is the start of the festival of [[Passover|Pesach]], corresponding to the [[full moon]] of Nisan.  Pesach is a spring festival associated with the barley harvest,<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities'' 3.248-251, Loeb Classical Library, 1930, pp. 437-438.</ref> so the leap-month mentioned above is intercalated periodically to keep this festival in the northern hemisphere's spring season. Since the adoption of a fixed calendar, intercalations in the Hebrew calendar have been at fixed points in a 19-year cycle.  Prior to this, the intercalation was determined empirically:

Oxygen is a member of the [[chalcogen]] [[Group (periodic table)|group]] on the [[periodic table]], and is a highly [[Chemical reaction|reactive]] [[nonmetal]]lic element that readily forms [[chemical compound|compounds]] (notably [[oxide]]s) with almost all other elements. By mass, oxygen is the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|third most abundant]] element in the universe after [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]<ref name="NBB297">[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.297</ref> and the [[abundances of the elements (data page)|most abundant]] element by mass in the [[crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]], making up almost half of the crust's mass.<ref name="lanl"/> Free oxygen is too chemically reactive to appear on Earth without the [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] action of living organisms, which use the energy of sunlight to produce elemental oxygen from water. Elemental {{chem|O|2}} only began to accumulate in the atmosphere after the evolutionary appearance of these organisms, roughly 2.5&nbsp;billion years ago.<ref>{{cite press release|title=NASA Research Indicates Oxygen on Earth 2.5 Billion Years ago|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/sep/HQ_07215_Timeline_of_Oxygen_on_Earth.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=2007-09-27|accessdate=2008-03-13}}</ref> Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the volume of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]].<ref name= "ECE500"/>

Because it comprises most of the mass in water, oxygen comprises most of the mass of living organisms (for example, about two-thirds of the human body's mass). All major classes of structural molecules in living organisms, such as [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, and [[fat]]s, contain oxygen, as do the major [[inorganic compound]]s that comprise animal shells, teeth, and bone. Elemental oxygen is produced by [[cyanobacteria]], [[algae]] and plants, and is used in [[cellular respiration]] for all complex life. Oxygen is toxic to [[Obligate anaerobe|obligately anaerobic organisms]], which were the dominant form of [[Evolutionary history of life|early life]] on Earth until {{chem|O|2}} began to accumulate in the atmosphere. Another form ([[allotropes of oxygen|allotrope]]) of oxygen, [[ozone]] ({{chem|O|3}}), helps protect the biosphere from [[ultraviolet radiation]] with the high-altitude [[ozone layer]], but is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by-product of [[smog]]. At even higher [[low earth orbit]] altitudes atomic oxygen is a significant presence and a cause of [[corrosion in space|erosion for spacecraft]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-08-08|url=http://www.spenvis.oma.be/spenvis/help/background/atmosphere/erosion.html|title=Atomic oxygen erosion|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070613121048/http://www.spenvis.oma.be/spenvis/help/background/atmosphere/erosion.html |archivedate = June 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Oxygen was independently discovered by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], in [[Uppsala]], in 1773 or earlier, and [[Joseph Priestley]] in [[Wiltshire]], in 1774, but Priestley is often given priority because his work was published first. The name ''oxygen'' was coined in 1777 by [[Antoine Lavoisier]],<ref name="mellor" /> whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then-popular [[phlogiston theory]] of [[combustion]] and [[corrosion]]. Oxygen is produced industrially by [[fractional distillation]] of liquefied air, use of [[zeolite]]s with [[pressure swing adsorption|pressure-cycling]] to concentrate oxygen from air, [[electrolysis of water]] and other means. Uses of oxygen include the production of steel, plastics and textiles; [[rocket propellant]]; [[oxygen therapy]]; and life support in aircraft, submarines, [[human spaceflight|spaceflight]] and [[underwater diving|diving]].''',
